# Torolizer


### Torolize is a C-based project that establishes a connection to a proxy server and routes traffic to a specified host and port. It uses a SOCKS-like protocol structure for request and response communication. This project is ideal for understanding socket programming, proxy server interactions, and basic network protocols.
